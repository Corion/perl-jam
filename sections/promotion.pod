=head1 PROMOTION

Z<promotion>

Six months before the event, possibly sooner, you need to start planning how you 
are going to promote the event. Newsletters and announcements all need to appear 
on your website, But you need to decide where else should you post them and 
other updates?

Some specific places online that you can approach include:

=over

=item * YAPC/YEF conference websites

=item * post as Perl Blogs user

=item * post on a personal blog associated with the Iron Man Perl Planet

=item * Perl Monks news postings

=item * YAPC/YEF conference mailing lists

=item * PM Group and local Perl group mailing lists

=item * Local and national Linux/Open Source group mailing lists

=item * National IT/Open Source printed media

=back

In addition there are now many social and micro-blogging networks available for 
you to get the word out. Signup to the following, and register a special 
conference account, if appropriate:

=over

=item * Facebook

=item * LinkedIn

=item * Twitter

=item * Identi.ca

On Facebook there is already a Perl Mongers user group which currently 
promotes YAPC events, and the admins are also willing to help promote workshops 
and large technical events too.

However, first you need to think about what you need to say. Promotion is both a 
chance to tell people the event exists and a means to provide details to the 
potential attendees, speakers and sponsors about how you are progressing with 
the organisation. However, the various outlets above don't necessarily need a 
big newsletter or the full announcements. Sometimes, a brief one line post with 
a link to the content on your website is enough.
