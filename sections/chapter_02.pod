=head0 THE PROPOSAL

For YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, there are committees to judge bid proposals and 
award a winning team the opportunity to host a YAPC event. The YAPC::NA venue 
committee is governed by The Perl Foundation, while the YAPC::Europe venue 
committee is governed by The YAPC::Europe Foundation.

Each year, usually several months before the forthcoming event, a Call For 
Venue is posted by the respective venue committees to the regular Perl news 
channels and user groups, asking for interest. However, it is helpful if you 
have already started to prepare a proposal before the Call For Venue is posted.

=head1 WHERE TO START?

So you've decided that you would like to host a YAPC. Where do you start? Your 
preparation can start anything from 4-6 months to 2-3 years before submitting 
your bid, and its worthwhile giving yourself time to do some research.

At its core, hosting a YAPC means providing a location for members of the Perl 
community (new and old) to get together, present and discuss projects and learn. 
Although YAPCs have grown to include many other features, these are still the 
main goals. As such, your initial preparations should focus on the following 
criteria:
