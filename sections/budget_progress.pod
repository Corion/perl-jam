=head1 YOUR BUDGET

Z<budget_progress>

From this point onwards your budget needs to be tightly controlled. You will 
need to keep a handle on what costs are mounting up (paid and unpaid) and what 
income you have coming in, as well as your targets to balance the books. If you 
have a group member who is good with figures or has accounting or bookkeeping 
skills, use them to help create a budget you can work with.

=head2 Income

=head3 Sponsorship

This is a tricky part of organising a conference, and is likely to be your 
biggest source of income. Hopefully your contacts with sponsors from the 
previous six months are starting bear fruit. Even if you have enough sponsorship 
at this point, don't stop trying to contact potential sponsors.

Promote your sponsorship pack and encourage community members to either talk to 
marketing staff within their own companies, or provide you with contacts. The 
sooner your budget becomes positive the sooner you can plan all the extras you 
thought of in your bid.

=head3 Registration Fees

Your next biggest source of income is the registration fee. Ideally you want 
this fee to cover the per-person costs as much as possible, so the attendee is 
paying their way for the attendee specific expenses. One way to decide a fee is 
to add up your costs on a per-attendee basis. You'll need to bear in mind any 
exemptions (see below) in your calculations.

Up to and including the 2005 conference, both YAPC::NA ($85) and YAPC::Europe 
(E<euro>99/E<pound>65) had managed to keep registration fees low. In 2006 
Chicago introduced an early bird scheme ($85/$100), while Birmingham offered a 
two tiered scheme (E<pound>100/E<pound>75). The early bird incentive can 
encourage a number of self-funding individuals to register early and provide 
early funds, while late deciders then have to pay the higher rate. With the two 
tier scheme, the standard rate was aimed at those individuals who were being 
paid to attend by their companies, and the individual rate for those who were 
self funded. By not having an early bird incentive, this meant registration was 
much more consistent throughout the registration period.

The goal is to try to keep the price as low as possible, as you don't want the 
registration fee to be a barrier to someone attending, particularly if an 
attendee is paying for themselves, which many do. The low fee also opens the 
door to students and other non-corporate types who want to get a taste of what 
Perl is all about. As a further alternative, you may want to introduce a Student 
Rate, which allows students to register for a very low fee on the understanding 
that they must provide proof of their student status when they sign-in at the 
registration desk. This is most useful for encouraging student attendance 
locally and nationally, although you may also get some international students 
too.

Many companies regularly send attendees to conferences and for a YAPC, the 
registration fee is a small part of the overall cost. Many companies would still 
send attendees even if the price doubled. By using this to help offset the cost 
for self-funding individuals and students, you can get quite a diverse mix of 
people. For YAPC::Europe 2009, a Corporate Rate of E<euro>2000 was introduced, 
which aside from covering conference attendance, also covered attendance to a 
class or tutorial taking place before or after the main conference days.

The reason a Corporate Rate was introduced was that a few attendees said 
convincing their boss that it was a valuable and professional conference to 
attend was difficult due to the low cost of the Conference Fee. Having a rate 
that matched similar corporate events, made it appear more appropriate to their 
managers. Strange, but true!

=head2 Exemptions

Typically presenters and keynote speakers are given free registration, since 
that's all you really have to offer. However, you need to decide what your 
cut-off point is, as talks can range from a 5-minute lightning talk to a full 
day seminar. One system commonly used is:

=over

=item * Keynotes: free

=item * Talks 20 minutes or more: free

=item * Talks less than 20 minutes, including lightning talks: full registration

=back

You may also want to grant free registration to some of your volunteers. Note 
that you are incurring cost for all of these people for things like venue hire, 
food, t-shirt, etc. so don't grant free admission to everyone. Save it as a 
reward for volunteers who helped consistently and productively throughout the 
planning process.

If anyone from the above groups wishes to pay the full registration to help with 
the running costs, then by all means allow them to do so, but ensure that it is 
not expected.

=head2 Expenditure

=head3 Insurance

This is something that often gets forgotten, until organisers talk to previous 
organisers. Have you thought about what would happen if something goes 
disastrously wrong? What if a week before your conference, your chosen venue 
becomes unavailable (fire, flooding, health and safety or even worse a 
previously unknown double booking)? You need insurance to ensure that you and 
your team are not held personally liable or become out of pocket if anything 
happens either during the conference or before that forces you to move or cancel 
the conference. Most event insurance is pretty standard, and most venues have 
insurance to cover the building. But this is definitely something you need to 
investigate.

In some cases, TPF may be able to help cover costs if you encounter some 
difficulties, but do not rely on this help. Wherever possible, ensure adequate 
insurance cover is provided. Specific areas of insurance coverage include:

=over

=item * Buildings Insurance (usually the venue has this, but double check)

=item * Event Insurance (you'll need to arrange this)

=item * Exhibitors Insurance (exhibitors usually have this)

=back

Regarding the latter, if you are allowing sponsors or other exhibitors to be 
onsite, with a manned or unmanned stand, then they will need to be covered by 
their own event insurance. In many cases your insurance for the event will not 
cover your exhibitors, so ensure they have a policy. Many large companies, who 
are regular exhibitors, will likely have a standard company policy.

What are you liable for? In most cases it will simply be the event itself. 
However, clarify with the venue exactly what they expect of you, and note 
anything that potentially you may be liable for in the event of breakage or 
cancellation.

=head2 Profits

It may seem odd to discuss profits, but many YAPCs now do operate in such a way 
that they end up with a profit from their budget. This is mostly due to the 
increase in sponsorship interest and means that future YAPCs and Perl projects 
can potentially have an additional source of revenue.

Any profits from YAPC::NA benefit The Perl Foundation directly, while for 
YAPC::Europe all profits have gone to the local host group for them to fund 
local activities (such as workshops or buying a projector for technical 
meetings), with any surplus going to future YAPCs, YEF or the Perl Foundation. 
Passing funds to the organisers for the following year provides them with a 
"float" to be used to book a venue and arrange deposits for any long lead time 
items.

=head2 Tax Exemption

This is a tricky area. If you are setting yourselves up as a Charity or 
Non-Profit organisation, then you may be able to claim tax exemption. However, 
this is not always easy and you are best advised to seek legal advice to clarify 
whether this is possible. If you are organising a Perl event in the US, the TPF 
can help to some degree as they are a tax exempt organisation, providing you 
plan to use their services to benefit from this. Contact them for details.
